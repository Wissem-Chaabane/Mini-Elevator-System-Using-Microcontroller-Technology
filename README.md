# Mini Elevator System Using Microcontroller Technology

## Project Overview

As part of our university project at ISET Sfax, we developed a Mini Elevator System using Microcontroller Technology. This system simulates the operation of an elevator, focusing on efficiency, safety, and user-friendliness.

## Features

- **Microcontroller:** ESP32
- **Components:** DC motor, sensors, 7-segment display
- **Mechanical Design:** Designed using SolidWorks
- **Control System:** Custom motor control circuit
- **Power Supply:** Optimally designed for the systemâ€™s requirements

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the components according to the wiring diagram provided in `docs/wiring.md`.
   - Assemble the mechanical parts using the designs in `hardware/SolidWorks`.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and load the `src/main.ino` file.
   - Upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Usage

- **Operation:** The elevator can move between floors based on button inputs and sensor readings.
- **Display:** The current floor number is shown on the 7-segment display.
